/*
Variables are "containers" for storing information.

Creating (Declaring) PHP Variables
In PHP, a variable starts with the $ sign, followed by the name of the variable:
*/

$txt = "hellow world!";  
$x = 5;
$y = 10.5;

/*
After the execution of the statements above, the variable $txt will hold the value Hello world!, 
the variable $x will hold the value 5, and the variable $y will hold the value 10.5.

Note: When you assign a text value to a variable, put quotes around the value.

Note: Unlike other programming languages, 
PHP has no command for declaring a variable. It is created the moment you first assign a value to it.

Think of variables as containers for storing data.
